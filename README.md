# 🥗 AI-Powered Scheduled Meal Viewer

### About the Project  
I used to spend **30–40 minutes every morning** deciding what to eat and then explaining it to my maid.  
This wasted both my time and hers.  

So, with the help of **AI**, I built a simple solution in just **1.5 hours**:  
a **Scheduled Meal Viewer**.
